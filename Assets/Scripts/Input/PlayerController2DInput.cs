///<summary>
/// Created By Paul O'Callaghan
/// 
/// This is used to get Player Input States. We use a generic input manager class called 
/// InputManager_2D here which can be subbed out for your own input manager. This is 
/// done this way to make the transition smoother with other projects.
/// 
/// An example would be as follows:
///     void InputUpdate()
///     {
///         jumpKeyPressed = InputManager_2D.ActionButtonDown();
///     }
/// 
/// Here jumpKeyPressed is tied to InputManager_2D class function called 
/// ActionButtonDown()
/// 
/// If you were to create your own class called GreatestInputManagerEver
/// and you and you wanted to use your own function called ActionPressed();
/// then you would change the InputUpdate to:
/// 
/// void InputUpdate()
/// {
///     jumpKeyPressed = GreatestInputManagerEver.ActionPressed();
/// }
/// 
/// This will save headaches in getting your project working with other setups.
/// 
/// 2DPlayerController has been created specifically for this project. 
/// Some changes will be expected to be made to your project to get it to work.
/// This script is without license warranty or liability
/// Use of this script is free to use even commercially.
/// User of script accepts terms that the creator accepts no liability for misrepresentation 
/// or illegal use of script.
/// Script may be modified and distributed without acknowlegement.
